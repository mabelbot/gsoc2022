Status: Draft (may not make sense until final review)


Notes:
- In grimoirelab-elk / grimoireelk/utils.py line 240 you will find that github is mapped to these connectors 
- Connectors - githubocean is raw, github is perceval, githubenrich is enrich, and githubcommand is again perceval?
- - class githubEnrich is the starting point of the github enricher
- def get_rich_item is the first step - the item stores the issue/pr json - each item is a pr/issue etc that item will be loaded into item variable and then the process starts
- there are some common things for the 3
- then , def enrich issue, or enrich PR
- then you have uploading to elastic search. it should be line 426 (max amount is 100 or 200 defined at top). You can see the bulk upload on line 428
- The enriched PRs now go into elastic search 
- You can add an enricher, but only enricher changes on line 240 (can copy line 240 and just change the enricher)
- you can just change the enricher and change the entries OR just change it directly
- Create a new enricher  - how to test if its workign? Some names to name enrichers are github_mm_enricher, etc. You can copy paste github enricher and building on top of it as well!
- Trigger it from micro.py and debug to get a sense of how the code flows
- once enrichers in place you need not test w/ SirMordred, can use Micromordred 
- Gitqm is one of the new enrichers built by @vchrombie, which he built on top of the github enricher
- you need to step into the enricher you have to collect enough data that match up with your metrics
- If you find some data is missing in the current implementation of git/github you may add some code 
- you can trigger one by one 
- python doc model file . this code will handle 2 parts - first, use a lot of query language supported by Elasticsearch to find out the data from elasticsearch. Then, based on your algorithm for MM CR then you calculate the result
- main or run will trigger it
