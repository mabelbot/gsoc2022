# Meeting 7PM 07-01-2022
Attendees: 
- Yehui
- Tieway
- Mabel

Status: Done


Notes:
- The usual Thursday meeting did not happen due to no one able to attend
- Discussed the difference between creating an entire new Perceval backend and just modifying the enrichers
- How to run in development mode: https://github.com/grimoirelab-gitee/grimoirelab/wiki/How-to-run-grimoirelab-gitee%3F (IN DEVELOPMENT MODE so we can change the github.py to do the code changes, instead of making a github3.py, for example)
- Go over config files for GrimoireLab Sir Mordred. 
- Go over alias concept
- after you enrich all data sources independently, then you add the code logic in the metric model, add such logic into the metric model (each of single document only stores 1 issue)
- We can add some code in a study - set up a new study specifically for the issue OR donâ€™t use studies but put in metric model. The key point to note here is that studies only consider 1 data source
- Organize it hierarchically divide into submodules
- Yehui currently use pandas to handle the data - not everything has to be a query 
- For the issue handling you can add a specific study for issue contributions and put it as a study in the enrich part. This is if it can be reused fro the conversion rate and other metrics too. So after coding you can put the studies in different places and look for common parts you can pull out


Action Items: 
- Talk with Taiwei about studies
