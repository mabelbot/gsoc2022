# Coding Period Week 1 + 2

## Summary
- Week 1 - consisted of meetings to scope out the project. See meeting notes from the two meetings that were held here: https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/blob/main/meetings/06-17-2022.md and https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/blob/main/meetings/06-19-2022.md
- Week 2 - more meetings to scope out the project. See meeting notes https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/blob/main/meetings/06-20-2022.md, https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/blob/main/meetings/06-21-2022.md
- Reviewed https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/docs/components/scenarios/ with Taiwei for data collection. Will review Taiwei proposal.
- I investigated the difference between our MM goal and existing "studies" in relation to conversion rate MM in grimoire lab. 
    - Answer: "Not yet, yes, conversion rate I hope is the first one. Yes, it is different from study, but you get reference from it . It is kinda like third level data analysis. First is raw data , second is enrich data , third is study. In my company we have implemented, but I hope take GSOC chance, we archive agreement upon Taiwei and your work."
- From speaking to Sean that although progress seems slow we have in fact learned a lot of real-world open source lessons already dealing with an unstructured problem and logistics issues during the bonding period. It is important that I get what I want out of the GSOC period and this is even at the cost of not finishing the project or making anything that "works" - although, we will strive for that.  
- Created my tracking repository https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/ with inspiration from @vchrombie 
- I created my organization as described to start contributing
    - Since this was my first time creating an organization I read a few resources to understand what to do, here's one of them: https://resources.github.com/downloads/github-guide-to-organizations.pdf
