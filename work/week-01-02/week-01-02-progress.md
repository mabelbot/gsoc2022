# Coding Period Week 1 + 2

## Summary
- Week 1 - consisted of meetings to scope out the project. See meeting notes from the two meetings that were held here: https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/blob/main/meetings/06-17-2022.md and https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/blob/main/meetings/06-19-2022.md
- Week 2 - more meetings to scope out the project. See meeting notes https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/blob/main/meetings/06-20-2022.md, https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/blob/main/meetings/06-21-2022.md
- Reviewed https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/docs/components/scenarios/ with Taiwei for data collection. Will review Taiwei proposal.
- I investigated the difference between our MM goal and existing "studies" in relation to conversion rate MM in grimoire lab. 
    - Answer: "Not yet, yes, conversion rate I hope is the first one. Yes, it is different from study, but you get reference from it . It is kinda like third level data analysis. First is raw data , second is enrich data , third is study. In my company we have implemented, but I hope take GSOC chance, we archive agreement upon Taiwei and your work."
- From speaking to Sean that although progress seems slow we have in fact learned a lot of real-world open source lessons already dealing with an unstructured problem and logistics issues during the bonding period. It is important that I get what I want out of the GSOC period and this is even at the cost of not finishing the project or making anything that "works" - although, we will strive for that.  
- Created my tracking repository https://github.com/mabelbot/gsoc2022/ with inspiration from @vchrombie 
- I created my organization as described to start contributing
    - Since this was my first time creating an organization I read a few resources to understand what to do, here's one of them: https://resources.github.com/downloads/github-guide-to-organizations.pdf


- Going back through the tutorial https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/docs/getting-started/dev-setup/. I also believe this is equivalent to https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/blob/master/Getting-Started.md (see https://github.com/chaoss/community/issues/305) (to make sure I didn't miss anything during bonding period)
    - The option I had used previously was "Source code and Docker" available here "In this method, the applications (Elasticsearch, Kibiter and MariaDB) are installed using docker and the GrimoireLab Components are installed using the source code."
    - Might need to redo this entire tutorial because of the organization (I did not use an organization before when I did the tutorial) (https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/1120)
    - I believe it can be done manually, [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9023533/fork-as-organization-after-already-forking-in-github#:~:text=Clicking%20the%20Fork%20button%20will,repository%20in%20your%20organization%20area.), but seeing as the script was really useful before I will try that again.
    - I am not sure which of the repos within Grimoirelab I will ultimately need, nor how to exclude some and still keep the dev setup functioning the same way as the tutorial, so I will try to fork all of them.
